pokedex with pokedex api

This web app displays all 151 oldschool pokemon fetched from the pok√©api v.2

In addition, I implemented a mini-arenafight where the player can choose his champion and then challenge random pokemon.

It is written in a purely procedual style without classes.

I wrote the script on my own without tutorials or guides.
